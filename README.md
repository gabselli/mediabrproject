### Project Overview

Hi, I'm Gabriele!

Iâ€™m a Master's student from Brazil, researching media bias in Brazilian media outlets. This project is part of my research in Political Science, focusing on the implications of media independence versus regulation on pluralism and competition in the media industry.

By employing machine learning techniques, I aim to analyze media bias in Brazil's major outlets and compare regulatory frameworks across different democracies.
